      The highest known permanently tolerable altitude is at 5,950 metres
      (19,520 ft). At very high altitudes, the decreasing atmospheric pressure
      means that less oxygen is available for breathing, and there is less
      protection against solar radiation (UV). Above 8,000 metres (26,000 ft)
      elevation, there is not enough oxygen to support human life. This is known
      as the "death zone".
