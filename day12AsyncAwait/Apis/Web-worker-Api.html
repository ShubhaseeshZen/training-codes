      //Web Workers are a simple means for web content to run scripts

      //without interfering with the user interface. In addition,
      //they can perform I/O using XMLHttpRequest (although the responseXML
      // and channel attributes are always null) or fetch (with no such restrictions).

      // by posting messages to an event handler specified by that code (and vice versa).
